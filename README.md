# Image-Classification-using-CNN-with-Tensorflow
In this notebook Food101 dataset has been taken, Data has been modeled with using Convoulation Neural Network. Tensorflow framework has been used along with further other libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib.
After training data accuracy has been analyzed and problem of overfitting found.
Resolved overfitting by condensing mode convoulational layers and Augmentation of data.
